# PyTorch in Unreal Engine

### What is this?
This project exists to extend on [P1ayer-1's](https://github.com/P1ayer-1) efforts of integrating PyTorch into Unreal Engine, and serves as a way to unify the dependencies, make his tutorials easier to understand at a glance (dive deep by watching them!), and to build examples that can be shared with everyone. See the [wiki](https://github.com/gpt-3d/pytorch/wiki) for project and plugin setup, or use the quickstart below to get moving immediately!
